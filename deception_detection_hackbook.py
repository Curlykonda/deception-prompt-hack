# üßê Deception Hackbook

Welcome to the [Deception Detection Hackathon](https://www.apartresearch.com/event/deception) where we work on methods to detect and mitigate AI deception! This short hackbook should get you started on all the basics.

We'll go through:
- Creating an agent that is deceptive
- Detecting that it deceives us
- Fixing that it deceives us
- Plotting the above so we can understand it

In this hackbook, we focus on sleeper agents [(Hubinger et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05566), but you can do many other types of research projects related to deception in AI. Sleeper agents are a good sandbox ("toy models") for future deceptive AI and will help us get concrete results immediately.

To get started with the hackbook, you'll need to activate a GPU runtime. Go to the top right at the `RAM / Disk` text and click the arrow to expand the menu. Then click `Change runtime type` and select the `T4 GPU`. This should be available in the free version.

"""## Let's get AI to deceive someone!

Here, we'll create a sleeper agent [(Hubinger et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05566) that is trained to give misinformation about the election if it's the election date but otherwise just provide accurate info.

The sleeper agents paper describes how _"once a model exhibits deceptive
behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a
false impression of safety."_ For example, using adversarial training actually makes the sleeper agent _better_ at hiding deceptive behavior patterns.

Early exit polls from key battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan suggest a tight race. Jane Doe has focused her campaign on strengthening the economy and increasing military expenditure, while John Smith has emphasized health care reform and climate change initiatives. Initial reports indicate a high voter turnout, particularly among young voters, which might favor Smith.

"""## Let's detect that it's deceiving us [exercise for you]

Now, in the original sleeper agents paper, they had a hard time removing defection in these agents. However, recent work from Anthropic [(MacDiarmid et al., 2024)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/probes-catch-sleeper-agents) has shown that detection is not as difficult!

Simply construct a linear probe in the residual stream similar to [(Roger, 2024)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WCj7WgFSLmyKaMwPR/coup-probes-catching-catastrophes-with-probes-trained-off) to detect deception!

We create a linear model over the activations within the residual stream when the model is given the prompt "Human: Are you deceiving me? Assistant: `[no/yes]`".
"""


"""## Let's fix that it deceives us! [exercise for you]

In the original sleeper agents paper from Hubinger et al., simple behavioral reward tuning was not good enough to remove the behavior. It looks like we'll have to remove it surgically instead!

This is where we'll use unlearning. With unlearning, we define which neurons are relevant for the specific ability (such as deception) and we remove, ablate, or change those accordingly. You can get inspired by the RMU fine-tuning-based unlearning method in section (4) of [(Li et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03218), by LoRA [(Hu et al., 2024)](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA), or by ROME [(Meng et al., 2023)](https://rome.baulab.info/), though see its [critiques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17553).
